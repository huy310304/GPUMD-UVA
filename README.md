# GPUMD-UVA (In-progress)

## Project Description

### Research Focus
The project focuses on investigating the thermal properties of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

### Tools and Methods
- Utilized the GPUMD package, Python, MATLAB, and Linux commands for simulation tasks.
- GPUMD package provided efficient MD simulation capabilities.
- Python and MATLAB facilitated data analysis and visualization.
- Linux commands were used to manage and execute simulations on the UVA Rivanna supercomputer.

### Simulation Tasks
- Executed over 30 thermal simulations for MgNiO and HEO alloys.
- Optimized simulations with more than 10 combinations of driving forces and runtimes for each alloy.

### Visualization and Analysis
- Generated over 10 graphs for each simulation to visualize thermal conductivity and spectral heat currents over the production time.
