# GPUMD-UVA (In-progress)

## üìù [A brief summarization poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUmejQSglso3Zh1EY1O8N_IgMgXjIA_r/view?usp=sharing)

### Research Focus
The project, led by Professor Keivan Esfarjani, with Bikash Timalsina as the graduate student, focuses on investigating the thermal properties of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

### Recent Work and Updates (Summer 2024)
- Running MD simulation with CoNiO and MgNiCuCoZnO using the J14 potential.
- Tuning the atom's concentration in the alloys to see how much can the Thermal Conductivity be tuned. 

### Tools and Methods
- Utilized the GPUMD package, Python, MATLAB, and Linux commands for simulation tasks.
- GPUMD package provided efficient MD simulation capabilities.
- Python and MATLAB facilitated data analysis and visualization.
- Linux commands were used to manage and execute simulations on the UVA Rivanna supercomputer.

### Simulation Tasks
- Conducted over 30 thermal simulations for MgNiO and HEO alloys.
- Optimized simulations with various combinations of driving forces and runtimes for each alloy.
- Repeated the process for different temperature ranges.

### Visualization and Analysis
- Generated numerous graphs for each simulation of different alloys at different temperature to visualize thermal conductivity and spectral heat currents over the production time.

## Simulation Results and Discussions
